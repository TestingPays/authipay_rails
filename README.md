# Authipay Rails Example Application

Integrated example application using [Authipay's Connect API](http://www.authipay.com/assets/authipay-connect.pdf).

## Requirements
In order to run this application you will need the following:
- [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (version 2.2+)
  - We recommend you use [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to manage your ruby versions
  - If you are using windows you can find a ruby installer [here](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (latest LTS)

## Setup

Firstly pull down the repo.

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/testingpays/authipay_rails.git
```

Next enter the directory and install the applications dependencies using bundler

``` bash
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

You also need to have an [Authipay](https://authipay.com) account setup. And from that you need to set the following credentials into environment variables:

```bash
AUTHIPAY_STORE_ID=1234567890
AUTHIPAY_USER_ID=1234567890
AUTHIPAY_SHARED_SECRET=t1p%0gBao
```

## Running the application

Now that we have the application installed and our api keys setup we can start using the application. firstly lets run the tests to make everything is in order.

```bash
$ rails test
```

Your tests should have ran successfully. now to run the application use the following command.

```bash
$ rails server
```

Your application should now be running [locally](http://localhost:3000/charges).
